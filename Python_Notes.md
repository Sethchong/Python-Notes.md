## Virtual Env Notes

- venv is a place for you to install the required packages that you need for that specific project and to keep things organised 
- so ideally you should create a file in your root named "dev"

**mkdir dev** -> this is to create a new file 
<br>
**python3 -m venv** [name] -> this is to create a new virtual env
<br>
**source [name of dir]/bin/activate** -> this is to activate a virtual env
<br>

**deactivate** -> to deactivate a virtual env
**delete venv** -> rm -r [name]
